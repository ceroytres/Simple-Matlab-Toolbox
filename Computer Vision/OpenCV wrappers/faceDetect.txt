function coord=face_detect(im,database,scaling_factor,minN,flags,minSize,maxSize)
Input:
im: grayscale double image 
database: string containing xml database filename
scaling_factor: Parameter specifying how much the image size is reduced at each image scale
minN: Parameter specifying how many neighbors each candidate rectangle should have to retain it
flags:
    CV_HAAR_DO_CANNY_PRUNING    1  Causes flat regions(no lines) to be skipped by classifier
    CV_HAAR_SCALE_IMAGE         2  Scales the image rather than detector 
    CV_HAAR_FIND_BIGGEST_OBJECT 4  Finds biggest object
    CV_HAAR_DO_ROUGH_SEARCH     8  Terminates search after first hit for
                                   a candidate usually used with CV_HAAR_FIND_BIGGEST_OBJECT
flags maybe or'ed together with bitor in MATLAB to combine multiple flags
minSize: Minimum possible object size. Objects smaller than that are ignored.
maxSize: Maximum possible object size. Objects larger than that are ignored.

Output:
coord contains the face coordinates in [x,y,w,h] format
